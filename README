This report presents the development and evaluation of an emotion classification system using 
natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). The system is designed to classify 
emotions from text data and generate suitable responses based on the detected emotions. The key 
objectives include data preprocessing, emotion classification using a logistic regression model, and 
the creation of a chatbot-like interface to provide user-specific responses. 

#Conclusion: 
The project demonstrated strong baseline performance in emotion classification and response 
generation. However, improvements in cultural adaptability and response customization are crucial 
to achieving a more inclusive and globally effective system.
